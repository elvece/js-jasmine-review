## Jasmine Testing Review

***Note:*** **Problems 1 - 5 were solved easily, assignment remains incomplete due to a sufficient grasp in understanding. Will finish at a later time**
***This repo contains my solution to the following exercise:***


### Steps

> Do each problem individually, using a test driven development approach!

1. Read over the problem.
1. Write a spec to test the problem.
1. Run the test. It should fail.
1. Write just enough code to get the test to pass.
1. Refactor the code, if necessary.

### Problems

1. Write a function that takes three random numbers from 0 to 100 as arguments and returns the largest one.
1. Write a function that takes a random number from 0 to 100 as an argument and returns all the odd numbers from 40 to that random number in an array. If the number is smaller than output the number.
1. Write a function that takes a random number from 0 to 100 as an argument and returns all the even numbers from 0 to the randomized number in an array.
1. Write a function that takes a random number from 0 to 100 as an argument and returns the all the odd numbers from 40 to that random number in an array. If the number is smaller than 40, return all the numbers down to the randomized one in an array - i.e., if the number is 37, you should return [40, 39, 38, 37].
1. Write a function that takes a random number from 0 to 10,000 as an argument and returns the sum of its digits. For instance, if the randomized number is 1049, the function should return 14.
1. Write a function that takes a random number from 0 to 10,0000 as an argument and calculates the sum of its digits repeatedly as long as the sum is a single digit. Return that number. For instance, if the randomized number is 1049, the function should return 5.
1. Write a function that takes two random numbers from 0 to 100 as arguments  and returns the smaller number that is greater than one, such that both numbers are divided by it with no remainder. For instance, for 9 and 6 you should print 3. If there isn't one, simply return "Sorry!".
1. Write a function that takes two random numbers from 0 to 100 as arguments and returns their least common multiple of them.
1. Write a function that takes two randomized numbers as arguments and returns their average and standard deviation.
